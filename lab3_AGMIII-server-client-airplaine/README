README:
this is a client server program designed to create a plane and sell tickets to clients.


there are two files requierd to make this program run properly. 

server.c, and client.c.

server.c is complied like this : gcc -o server server.c -pthread
and run like this ./server, or the dimentions of the plane that the server works on may be entered like so:./server row column, ./server 5 5 will make a plane that is 5x5

and client is commpiled like: gcc -o client client.c 
and run like this: ./client 

the assinment states to have a ini file to give the ip,port,and time out. this file dose not work here, if one is entered nothing diferent will happen. 

use:
when the server is loaded it will start to wait for clients.

when a client is loaded it will ask the user how many tickets they want: the proper input is an integer below the max size of the planeand above 0.

next the client will ask how to select the tickets for each ticket, automatic, or manual; you can either type the word, or just the fist letter, a or m.

if the user selects automatic, they will be given the next avalible seat on the plane. 
if the user selects manual they will be asked to type 2 numbers between 1 and n, and 1 and m. seperated by a space. for example "2 2" will select the second row and second column.

this will continue until all tickets are allocated. 

once all tickets are sold the server will empty the plane and start a new one , with a message that the plane took off and a new one arived.
